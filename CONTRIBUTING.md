Thanks for helping keep this list useful! Contributing is simple — **just open an issue.**

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### Found a student offer? → [Open an Issue](https://github.com/Justme017/New-folder/issues/new/choose)

That's it. No fork, no PR, no code. Just fill out the template.

### How it works:

```
1. 📝 You open an issue using one of the templates
2. 👍 Other students upvote (react 👍) if they've used it
3. ✅ I verify the offer from the official source
4. ➕ I add it to the README in the correct format
```

### 3 Issue Templates:

| Template | When to Use |
|:---------|:------------|
| **➕ Suggest a Student Offer** | You found a free/discounted tool for students |
| **✏️ Update an Existing Offer** | An offer's details changed (duration, benefits, etc.) |
| **🔗 Report Broken Link** | A link in the README is dead or outdated |

---

## ✅ What Qualifies

- **Student-only** offers — must require verification (academic email, SheerID, ISIC, or GitHub Student Pack)
- General free tiers that everyone gets do **NOT** qualify
- Must have an **official source** (vendor website, official docs — no blogs or YouTube)

## ❌ What Doesn't Qualify

- General free tiers available to everyone
- Referral codes or affiliate links
- Unverified claims from third-party sites
- Tools with no official student program page

## 📖 Duration Types

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:------:|:--------|
| 🔄 | **Renewable** — while you remain a student |
| ⏳ | **Fixed-term** — specific duration (months) |
| 💰 | **Credit-based** — set amount + expiry date |

---

## 💡 Tips for a Good Submission

1. **Include the official student page URL** — this is the most important thing
2. **Mention how you verified** — did you use your .edu email? SheerID? GitHub Pack?
3. **Note any limitations** — country restrictions, card required, usage caps
4. **Check existing issues first** — if someone already suggested it, just upvote 👍

## 🤖 Automation

A GitHub Action runs **every Monday** to:
- Check all links in the README for broken URLs
- Auto-create an issue if dead links are found
- Update the offer count badge
